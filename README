Tool for translating between alphanumeric and morse code.

Input should only contain alphanumeric and spaces, or dot '.', dash '-' and spaces.

Input cannot contain a mix of alphanumeric and morse code.

Morse code input should contain spacing between each character pattern.

Spacing between alphanumeric characters does not matter.

Enjoy!
